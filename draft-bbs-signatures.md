.# Abstract

BBS is a digital signature scheme categorized as a form of short group signature that supports several unique properties. Notably, the scheme supports signing multiple messages whilst producing a single output digital signature. Through this capability, the possessor of a signature is able to derive proofs that selectively disclose subsets of the originally signed set of messages, whilst preserving the verifiable authenticity and integrity of the messages. Furthermore, these derived proofs are said to be zero-knowledge in nature as they do not reveal the underlying signature; instead, what they reveal is a proof of knowledge of the undisclosed signature.

# Introduction

A digital signature scheme is a fundamental cryptographic primitive that is used to provide data integrity and verifiable authenticity in various protocols. The core premise of digital signature technology is built upon asymmetric cryptography where-by the possessor of a private key is able to sign a message, where anyone in possession of the corresponding public key matching that of the private key is able to verify the signature.

Beyond the core properties of a digital signature scheme, BBS signatures provide multiple additional unique properties, three key ones are:

**Selective Disclosure** - The scheme allows a signer (issuer) to sign multiple messages and produce a single -constant size- output signature. An intermediary (prover) then possessing the messages and the signature can generate a proof whereby they can choose which messages to disclose, while leaking no-information about the un-disclosed messages. The proof itself guarantees the integrity and authenticity of the disclosed messages (e.g. that they were originally signed by the issuer).

**Unlinkable Proof Presentations** - The proofs generated by the scheme are known as zero-knowledge, proofs-of-knowledge of the signature, meaning a verifying party in receipt of a proof is unable to determine which signature was used to generate the proof, removing a common source of correlation. In general each proof generated is indistinguishable from random even for two proofs generated from the same signature.

**Proof of Possession** - The proofs generated by the scheme prove to a verifier that the party who generated the proof (prover) was in possession of a signature without revealing it. The scheme also supports binding a presentation header to the generated proof. The presentation header can include arbitrary information such as a cryptographic nonce, an audience/domain identifier to ensure the generated proof can only be used appropriately, including providing a way for a verifier to detect a replay attack, or any other information a protocol may require to be cryptographically tied to a proof.

Refer to (#usecases) for an elaboration on where and when these properties are useful

msg
: An input message to be signed by the signature scheme.

generator
: A valid point on the selected sub-group of the curve being used that is used to commit a value.

## Notation

The following notation and primitives are used:

a || b
: Denotes the concatenation of octet strings a and b.

I \\ J
: For sets I and J, denotes the difference of the two sets i.e., all the elements of I that do not appear in J, in the same order as they were in I.

X\[a..b\]
: Denotes a slice of the array `X` containing all elements from and including the value at index `a` until and including the value at index `b`. Note when this syntax is applied to an octet string, each element in the array `X` is assumed to be a single byte.

Terms specific to pairing-friendly elliptic curves that are relevant to this document are restated below, originally defined in [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves]

E1, E2
: elliptic curve groups defined over finite fields. This document assumes that E1 has a more compact representation than E2, i.e., because E1 is defined over a smaller field than E2.

G1, G2
: subgroups of E1 and E2 (respectively) having prime order p.

GT
: a subgroup, of prime order p, of the multiplicative group of a field extension.

e
: G1 x G2 -> GT: a non-degenerate bilinear map.

r
: The prime order of the G1 and G2 subgroups.

P1, P2
: points on G1 and G2 respectively. For a pairing-friendly curve, this document denotes operations in E1 and E2 in additive notation, i.e., P + Q denotes point addition and x \* P denotes scalar multiplication. Operations in GT are written in multiplicative notation, i.e., a \* b is field multiplication.

Identity\_G1, Identity\_G1
: The identity element for the G1 and G2 subgroups respectively.

hash\_to\_curve\_g1(ostr) -> P
: A cryptographic hash function that takes as an arbitrary octet string input and returns a point in G1 as defined in [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve].

point\_to\_octets_g1(P) -> ostr, point\_to\_octets_g2(P) -> ostr
: returns the canonical representation of the point P for the respective subgroup as an octet string. This operation is also known as serialization.

octets\_to\_point_g1(ostr) -> P, octets\_to\_point_g2(ostr) -> P
: returns the point P for the respective subgroup corresponding to the canonical representation ostr, or INVALID if ostr is not a valid output of the respective point\_to\_octets_g* function.  This operation is also known as deserialization.

subgroup\_check(P) -> VALID or INVALID
: returns VALID when the point P is an element of the subgroup of order p, and INVALID otherwise. This function can always be implemented by checking that p \* P is equal to the identity element.  In some cases, faster checks may also exist, e.g., [@Bowe19].

# Scheme Definition

This section defines the BBS signature scheme, including the parameters required to define a concrete ciphersuite.

## Parameters

The schemes operations defined in (#operations) depend the following parameters:

* A pairing-friendly elliptic curve, plus associated functionality given in Section 1.4.

* hash, a hash function that MUST be a secure cryptographic hash function. For security, hash MUST output at least `ceil(log2(r))` bits, where r is the order of the subgroups G1 and G2 defined by the pairing-friendly elliptic curve. See [encoding of elements to be hashed](#encoding-of-elements-to-be-hashed) for details on how the inputs to the function must be encoded.

* xof, a cryptographically secure extendable-output function like SHAKE128 or SHAKE256. xof outputs any desirable amount of bytes using the `.read(int)` method. See [Encoding of elements to be hashed](#encoding-of-elements-to-be-hashed) for details on how the inputs to the function must be encoded.

* PRF(n): a pseudo-random function similar to [@!RFC4868]. Returns n pseudo randomly generated bytes.

## Considerations

### Subgroup Selection

In definition of this signature scheme there are two possible variations based upon the sub-group selection, namely where public keys are defined in G2 and signatures in G1 OR the opposite where public keys are defined in G1 and signatures in G2. Some pairing cryptography based digital signature schemes such as [@I-D.irtf-cfrg-bls-signature] elect to allow for both variations, because they optimize for different things. However, in the case of this scheme, due to the operations involved in both signature and proof generation being computational in-efficient when performed in G2 and in the pursuit of simplicity, the scheme is limited to a construction where public keys are in G2 and signatures in G1.

### Messages and generators

Throughout the operations of this signature scheme, each message that is signed is paired with a specific generator (point in G1). Specifically, if a generator `H_1` is multiplied with `msg_1` during signing, then `H_1` MUST be multiplied with `msg_1` in all other operations (signature verification, proof generation and proof verification).

Aside from the message generators, the scheme uses two additional generators: `H_s` and `H_d`. The first (`H_s`), is used for the blinding value (`s`) of the signature. The second generator (`H_d`), is used to sign the signature's domain, which binds both signature and proof to a specific context and cryptographically protects any potential application-specific information (for example, messages that must always be disclosed etc.).

### Encoding of elements to be hashed.

To avoid ambiguity, each element passed to the hash or the xof function, including situations when multiple elements are supplied in a concatenated form, must first be encoded to an appropriate format, depending on its type. Specifically,

- Points in G1 or G2 must be encoded using the `point_to_octets_g*` implementation for a particular ciphersuite.
- Non-negative integers must be encoded using `I2OSP` with an output length of 8 bytes.
- Scalars must be zero-extended to a fixed length, defined by a particular ciphersuite.
- Octet strings must be zero-extended to a length that is a multiple of 8 bits. Then, the extended value is encoded directly.
- ASCII strings must be transformed into octet strings using UTF-8 encoding.

After encoding, octet strings MUST be prepended with a value representing the length of their binary representation in the form of the number of bytes. If the octet string represents a DST, then its length must be encoded to octets using I2OSP with ouptut length of 1 byte. If it is a generic octet string (not representing a DST), its length must be encoded to octets using I2OSP with ouptut length of 8 bytes. The combined value (encoded value + length prefix) binary representation is then encoded as a single octet string. For example, the string `0x14d` will be encoded as `0x0000000000000002014d`. DSTs with length larger than 2^8 - 1 MUST be rejected. Other octet-strings (not DSTs) with length larger than 2^64 - 1, MUST also be rejected.

As an example of the above transformations, consider the following. Assume that one wants to hash together the message `"Jane"` and the number `25`. The procedure would be

- Calculate octets of the message `"Jane"` and the number `25` as,
   ```
   message_octets = 0x4a616e65
   number_octets = I2OSP(25, 4) = 0x0000000000000019
   ```
- Calculate the length of the message binary representation (message_octets) and transform it to octets i.e., `len(message_octets) = I2OSP(4, 8) = 0x0000000000000004`.
- Prepend the length calculated in the previous step to the message's binary representation and concatenate the result with the octets representing the number `25`, to get the octets to be hashed,
   ```
   octets_to_hash = len(message_octets) || message_octets || number_octets =
                  = 0x00000000000000044a616e650000000000000019
   ```
- hash the result (i.e., `hash(octets_to_hash)`)

For readability, this document makes these transformations implicitly, but they MUST precede every call to the hash or xof function.

Optional input/parameters to operations that feature in a call to a HASH or XOF function, that are not supplied to the operation should default to an empty octet string. For example, if X is an optional input/parameter that is not supplied, whilst A and B are required, then the procedural step of `HASH(A || X || B)` MUST be evaluated to `HASH(A || "" || B)`.

## Operations

### KeyGen

This operation generates a secret key (SK) deterministically from a secret octet string (IKM).

KeyGen uses an HKDF [@!RFC5869] instantiated with the hash function hash.

For security, IKM MUST be infeasible to guess, e.g. generated by a trusted source of randomness.

IKM MUST be at least 32 bytes long, but it MAY be longer.

Because KeyGen is deterministic, implementations MAY choose either to store the resulting SK or to store IKM and call KeyGen to derive SK when necessary.

KeyGen takes an optional parameter, key\_info. This parameter MAY be used to derive multiple independent keys from the same IKM.  By default, key\_info is the empty string.

```
SK = KeyGen(IKM)

Inputs:

- IKM (REQUIRED), a secret octet string. See requirements above.

Parameters:

- key_info (OPTIONAL), an octet string. if this is not supplied, it MUST default to an empty string.

Definitions:

- HKDF-Extract is as defined in [@!RFC5869], instantiated with hash function hash.
- HKDF-Expand is as defined in [@!RFC5869], instantiated with hash function hash.
- I2OSP and OS2IP are as defined in [@!RFC8017], Section 4.
- L is the integer given by ceil((3 * ceil(log2(r))) / 16).
- INITSALT is the ASCII string "BBS-SIG-KEYGEN-SALT-".

Outputs:

- SK, a uniformly random integer such that 0 < SK < r.

Procedure:

1. salt = INITSALT

2. SK = 0

3. while SK == 0:

4.     salt = hash(salt)

5.     PRK = HKDF-Extract(salt, IKM || I2OSP(0, 1))

6.     OKM = HKDF-Expand(PRK, key_info || I2OSP(L, 2), L)

7.     SK = OS2IP(OKM) mod r

8. return SK
```

**Note** This operation is the RECOMMENDED way of generating a secret key, but its use is not required for compatibility, and implementations MAY use a different KeyGen procedure. For security, such an alternative MUST output a secret key that is statistically close to uniformly random in the range 1 <= SK < r.

### SkToPk

This operation takes a secret key (SK) and outputs a corresponding public key (PK).

```
PK = SkToPk(SK)

Inputs:

- SK (REQUIRED), a secret integer such that 0 < SK < r.

Outputs:

- PK, a public key encoded as an octet string.

Procedure:

1. W = SK * P2

2. PK = W

3. return point_to_octets_g2(PK)
```

### KeyValidate

This operation checks if a public key is valid.

As an optimization, implementations MAY cache the result of KeyValidate in order to avoid unnecessarily repeating validation for known public keys.

```
result = KeyValidate(PK)

Inputs:

- PK (REQUIRED), an octet string of the form outputted by the SkToPk operation.

Outputs:

- result, either VALID or INVALID.

Procedure:

1. W = octets_to_point_g2(PK)

2. if W is INVALID, return INVALID

3. if subgroup_check(W) is INVALID, return INVALID

4. If W == Identity_G2, return INVALID

5. return VALID
```

### Sign

This operation computes a deterministic signature from a secret key (SK) and optionally over a header and or a vector of messages.

```
signature = Sign(SK, PK, header, to_sign)

Inputs:

- SK (REQUIRED), an octet string of the form outputted by the KeyGen
                 operation.
- PK (REQUIRED), an octet string of the form outputted by the SkToPk
                 operation provided the above SK as input.
- header (OPTIONAL), an octet string containing context and application
                     specific information. If not supplied, it defaults
                     to an empty string.
- to_sign (OPTIONAL), a list of (generator, message) pairs. Generators
                      must be G1 points, and the messages must be
                      non-zero scalars mod r. If not supplied, will
                      default to the empty array ("[]").


Parameters:

- Ciphersuite_ID (REQUIRED), ASCII string. The unique ciphersuite ID.
- H_s (REQUIRED), point of G1. The generator for the blinding value of
                  the signature.
- H_d (REQUIRED), point of G1. The generator used to sign the signature
                  domain.

Definitions:

- L, is the non-negative integer representing the number of messages
     to be signed i.e., L = length(to_sign). Note, if the to_sign list
     is not supplied, the value of L MUST evaluate to zero (0).

Outputs:

- signature, a signature encoded as an octet string.

Procedure:

1. [(H_1, msg_1), ..., (H_L, msg_L)] = to_sign

2. W = octets_to_point_g2(PK)

3. if W is INVALID, abort

4. generators =  (H_s || H_d || H_1 || ... || H_L)

5. domain = hash_to_scalar((PK || L || generators || Ciphersuite_ID || header), 1)

6. (e, s) = hash_to_scalar((SK  || domain || msg_1 || ... || msg_L), 2)

7. B = P1 + H_s * s + H_d * domain + H_1 * msg_1 + ... + H_L * msg_L

8. A = B * (1 / (SK + e))

9. signature_octets = signature_to_octets(A, e, s)

10. return signature_octets
```

**Note** When computing step 11 of the above procedure there is an extremely small probability (around `2^(-r)`) that the condition `(SK + e) = 0 mod r` will be met. How implementations evaluate the inverse of the scalar value `0` may vary, with some returning an error and others returning `0` as a result. If the returned value from the inverse operation `1/(SK + e)` does evalute to `0` the value of `A` will equal `Identity_G1` thus an invalid signature. Implementations MAY elect to check `(SK + e) = 0 mod r` prior to step 11, and or `A != Identity_G1` after step 11 to prevent the production of invalid signatures.

### Verify

This operation checks that a signature is valid for a given header and vector of messages against a supplied public key (PK).

```
result = Verify(PK, signature, header, signed)

Inputs:

- PK (REQUIRED), an octet string of the form outputted by the SkToPk
                 operation.
- signature (REQUIRED), an octet string of the form outputted by the
                        Sign operation.
- header (OPTIONAL), an octet string containing context and application
                     specific information. If not supplied, it defaults
                     to an empty string.
- signed (OPTIONAL), a list of generator and message pairs. Generators
                     must be G1 points, and the messages must be
                     non-zero scalars mod r. If not supplied, will
                     default to the empty array ("[]").

Parameters:

- Ciphersuite_ID (REQUIRED), ASCII string. The unique ciphersuite ID.
- H_s (REQUIRED), point of G1. The generator for the blinding value of
                  the signature.
- H_d (REQUIRED), point of G1. The generator used to sign the signature
                  domain.

Definitions:

- L, is the non-negative integer representing the number of signed
     messages i.e., length(signed). Note, if signed is not supplied as
     an input, the value of L MUST evaluate to zero (0).

Outputs:

- result, either VALID or INVALID.

Procedure:

1. [(H_1, msg_1), ..., (H_L, msg_L)] = signed

2. signature_result = octets_to_signature(signature)

3. if signature_result is INVALID, return INVALID

4. (A, e, s) = signature_result

5. if KeyValidate(PK) is INVALID, return INVALID

6. W = octets_to_point_g2(PK)

7. generators =  (H_s || H_d || H_1 || ... || H_L)

8. domain = hash_to_scalar((PK || L || generators || Ciphersuite_ID || header), 1)

9. B = P1 + H_s * s + H_d * domain + H_1 * msg_1 + ... + H_L * msg_L

10. C1 = e(A, W + P2 * e)

11. C2 = e(B, P2)

12. return C1 == C2
```

### ProofGen

This operation computes a zero-knowledge proof-of-knowledge of a signature, while optionally selectively disclosing from the original set of signed messages. The "prover" may also supply a presentation header, see [presentation header selection](#presentation-header-selection) for more details.

The generators and messages are supplied as a list of pairs (called `signed`) of the form `(H_i, msg_i)`. The generator `H_i` must be a point on G1 (see [Messages and Generators](#messages-and-generators)) and the message `msg_i` must be a non-zero scalar mod r representing a signed message. The list of pairs MUST be the same and in the same order as the `to_sign` list that was supplied to [Sign](#sign), when creating the signature that will be inputted in this operation. To indicate which messages will be revealed by the resulting proof, the operation takes as an input a list of at most `length(signed)`, integers (`revealedIndexes`) in ascending order, representing the indexes of the (generator, message) pairs containing the messages that will be revealed. Each of those indexes MUST be non-negative integers, in the range from 1 to L, where L the total number of signed messages (i.e., `L = length(signed)`). If one of the `signed` or `revealedIndexes` lists is not supplied, it will default to the empty array ("[]").

For example if `[(H_1, msg_1), (H_2, msg_2), (H_3, msg_3)]` was supplied to [Sign](#sign), and the prover wants to reveal only `msg_1` and `msg_3`, the two lists that must be supplied to ProofGen are the list: `signed = [(H_1, msg_1), (H_2, msg_2), (H_3, msg_3)]` (in that order, otherwise the proof will not validate) and the list: `revealedIndexes = [1, 3]`.

```

5. (H_j1, msg_j1), ..., (H_jU, msg_jU) = signed[j1], ..., signed[jU]

6. signature_result = octets_to_signature(signature)

7. if signature_result is INVALID, return INVALID

8. (A, e, s) = signature_result

9. if KeyValidate(PK) is INVALID, return INVALID

10. generators =  (H_s || H_d || H_1 || ... || H_L)

```

### ProofVerify

This operation checks that a proof is valid for a header, vector of generators, revealed messages, and presentation header against a public key (PK).

The generators are supplied as a list (called `generators`) of points in G1. The generators MUST be the same as the ones supplied to the [Sign](#sign) operation, as part of the (generator, message) pairs of the `to_sign` input list. The generators list MUST also be sorted based on the order that the (generator, message) pairs had in that list. More specifically, if the list `to_sign = [(H_1, msg_1), (H_2, msg_2), ..., (H_L, msg_L)]` was supplied to the Sign operation as input, then the generators list supplied as input to ProoVerify MUST equal `[H_1, H_2, ..., H_L]`, in that order.

The revealed messages are supplied as a list of at most `length(generators)` pairs, of the form (revealed_message, index), containing a non-zero scalar mod r, representing a (revealed) message, and an integer in the 1 to L range, representing the index that the (generator, message) pair containing the revealed_message had in the `to_sign` list. The list MUST be sorted based on the (ascending) order of the indexes. If the list is not supplied, it will default to the empty array ("[]").

For example, if the list `to_sign = [(H_1, msg_1), (H_2, msg_2), (H_3, msg_3)]` was supplied to the Sign operation, and the proof only reveals the first and the third message (i.e., the list `revealedIndexes = [1, 3]` was supplied to [ProofGen](#proofgen)), the lists that must be supplied to ProofVerify are `generators = [H_1, H_2, H_3]` (in that order, otherwise the proof will not be validated) and `revealedMsgs = [(msg_1, 1), (msg_3, 3)]`.

```

                     the original signed list. Each index MUST be in the

                  domain.

Definitions:

     messages i.e., length(revealed). Note, if revealed is not supplied
     as an input, the value of L MUST evaluate to zero (0).

     messages i.e., R = length(revealedMsgs). If revealedMsgs is not
     suplied as an input, the value of R MUST evaluate to zero (0).

     messages i.e., U = L - R.

- result, either VALID or INVALID.

Procedure:

1. if length(revealedMsgs) > L, return INVALID

2. (msg_i1, i1), ..., (msg_iR, iR) = revealedMsgs

3. [j1, ..., jU] = (1, ..., L) \ [i1, ..., iR]

4. H_i1, ..., H_iR = generators[i1], ..., generators[iR]

6. if KeyValidate(PK) is INVALID, return INVALID

7. (A', Abar, D, c, e^, r2^, r3^, s^, (m^_j1,...,m^_jU)) = proof

8. generators =  (H_s || H_d || H_1 || ... || H_L)

9. domain = hash_to_scalar((PK || L || generators || Ciphersuite_ID || header), 1)

10. C1 = (Abar - D) * c + A' * e^ + H_s * r2^

11. T = P1 + H_s * domain + H_i1 * msg_i1 + ... H_iR * msg_iR

15. if A' == 1, return INVALID

16. if e(A', W) * e(Abar, -P2) != 1, return INVALID

17. return VALID
```

### CreateGenerators

The CreateGenerators operation defines how to create a set of generators that form a part of the public parameters used by the BBS Signature scheme to accomplish operations such as Sign, Verify, ProofGen and ProofVerify.

```
generators = CreateGenerators(dst, message_generator_seed, length);

Inputs:

- dst (REQUIRED), octet string. Domain Separation Tag.
- message_generator_seed (REQUIRED), octet string.
- length (REQUIRED), unsigned integer. Number of generators to create from the seed and dst.

Outputs:

- generators, an array of generators.

Procedure:

1. h = xof(seed)

2. for i in 0 to length:

3.    generator_i = Identity_G1

4.    while(generator_i == Identity_G1 or generator_i == P1)

5.        candidate = hash_to_curve_g1(h.read(xof_no_of_bytes), dst)

6.        if candidate not in generators: generator_i = candidate

7. return generators
```

### MapMessageToScalar

There are multiple ways in which messages can be mapped to their respective scalar values, which is their required form to be used with the Sign, Verify, ProofGen and ProofVerify operations.

#### MapMessageToScalarAsHash

This operation takes an input message and maps it to a scalar value via a cryptographic hash function for the given curve.

```
result = MapMessageToScalarAsHash(msg, dst)

Inputs:

- msg (REQUIRED), octet string.
- dst (REQUIRED), octet string. Domain separation tag; note this is not defined as a function argument as per [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve] instead as a parameter.

Outputs:

- result, a scalar value.

Procedure:

1. If len(dst) > 2^8 - 1 or len(msg) > 2^64 - 1, abort

2. dst_prime = I2OSP(len(dst), 1) || dst

3. msg_prime = I2OSP(len(msg), 8) || msg

4. result = hash_to_scalar(msg_prime || dst_prime, 1)

5. return result
```

### Hash to scalar

This operation describes how to hash an arbitrary octet string to `n` scalar values in the multiplicative group of integers mod r. This procedure acts as a helper function, and it is used internally in various places within the operations described in the spec. To map a message to a scalar that would be passed as input to the [Sign](#sign), [Verify](#verify), [ProofGen](#proofgen) and [ProofVerify](#proofgen) functions, one must use [MapMessageToScalarAsHash](#mapmessagetoscalar) instead.

The `hash_to_scalar` procedure hashes elements using an extendable-output function (xof). Applications not wishing to use an xof may use `hash_to_field` defined in Section 5.3 of [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve], combined with `expand_message_xmd` defined in Section 5.4.1 of the same document, in place of `hash_to_scalar`. In that case, every element outputted by `hash_to_field` that is equal to 0 MUST be rejected. If that occurs, one should calculate more field elements (using `hash_to_field`), until they get `n` non-zero elements (for example, if there is only one 0 in the output of `hash_to_field(msg, 2)` one must try to calculate `hash_to_field(msg, 3)` etc.).

```
result = hash_to_scalar(msg_octets, n)

Inputs:

- msg_octets (REQUIRED), octet string. The message to be hashed.
- n (REQUIRED), non-negative integer. The number of scalars to output.

Parameters:

- r (REQUIRED), non-negative integer. The prime order of the G_1 and G_2 groups,
     defined by the ciphersuite.

Outputs:

- (scalar_1, ..., scalar_n), a list of non-zero scalars mod r.

Procedure:

1. h = xof(msg_octets)

2. for i in (1, ..., n):

3.     scalar_i = OS2IP(h.read(64)) mod r

4.     if scalar_i is 0, go back to step 3

5. return (scalar_1, ..., scalar_n)
```

### OctetsToSignature

This operation describes how to decode an octet string, validate it and return the underlying components that make up the signature.

```
(A, e, s) = octets_to_signature(signature_octets)

Inputs:

- signature_octets (REQUIRED), octet string of the form output from signature_to_octets operation.

Outputs:

- A, a valid point in the G1 subgroup which is not equal to the identity point.
- e, an integer representing a valid scalar value within the range of 0 < e < r.
- s, an integer representing a valid scalar value within the range of 0 < e < r.

Procedure:

1. if len(signature_octets) != (octet_point_length + 2 * octet_scalar_length), return INVALID

2. a_octets = signature_octets[0..(octet_point_length - 1)]

3. A = octets_to_point_g1(a_octets)

4. if A is INVALID, return INVALID

5. if A == Identity_G1, return INVALID

5. index = octet_point_length

6. e = OS2IP(signature_octets[index..(index + octet_scalar_length - 1)])

7. if e = 0 OR e >= r, return INVALID

8. index += octet_scalar_length

9. s = OS2IP(signature_octets[index..(index + octet_scalar_length - 1)])

10. if s = 0 OR s >= r, return INVALID

11. return (A, e, s)
```

### SignatureToOctets

This operation describes how to encode a signature to an octet string.

*Note* this operation deliberately does not perform the relevant checks on the inputs `A` `e` and `s`
because its assumed these are done prior to its invocation, e.g as is the case with the Sign operation.

```
signature_octets = signature_to_octets(A, e, s)

Inputs:

- A (REQUIRED), a valid point in the G1 subgroup which is not equal to the identity point.
- e (REQUIRED), an integer representing a valid scalar value within the range of 0 < e < r.
- s (REQUIRED), an integer representing a valid scalar value within the range of 0 < e < r.

Outputs:

- signature_octets, octet string.

Procedure:

1. A_octets = point_to_octets_g1(A)

2. e_octets = I2OSP(e, octet_scalar_length)

3. s_octets = I2OSP(s, octet_scalar_length)

4. return (a_octets || e_octets || s_octets)
```

# Security Considerations

## Validating public keys

It is RECOMMENDED for any operation in (#operations) involving public keys that do not have an explicit invocation to the KeyValidate operation (#keyvalidate) documented in their procedure, that this check be performed prior to executing the operation. An example of where this recommendation applies is the sign (#sign) operation. An example of where an explicit invocation to the KeyValidate operation (#keyvalidate) is already defined and therefore required is the verify (#verify) operation.

## Skipping membership checks

Some existing implementations skip the subgroup\_check invocation in Verify (#verify), whose purpose is ensuring that the signature is an element of a prime-order subgroup.  This check is REQUIRED of conforming implementations, for two reasons.

1.  For most pairing-friendly elliptic curves used in practice, the pairing operation e (#notation) is undefined when its input points are not in the prime-order subgroups of E1 and E2. The resulting behavior is unpredictable, and may enable forgeries.

2.  Even if the pairing operation behaves properly on inputs that are outside the correct subgroups, skipping the subgroup check breaks the strong unforgeability property [@ADR02].

## Side channel attacks

Implementations of the signing algorithm SHOULD protect the secret key from side-channel attacks.  One method for protecting against certain side-channel attacks is ensuring that the implementation executes exactly the same sequence of instructions and performs exactly the same memory accesses, for any value of the secret key. In other words, implementations on the underlying pairing-friendly elliptic curve SHOULD run in constant time.

## Randomness considerations

The IKM input to KeyGen MUST be infeasible to guess and MUST be kept secret. One possibility is to generate IKM from a trusted source of randomness.  Guidelines on constructing such a source are outside the scope of this document.

Secret keys MAY be generated using other methods; in this case they MUST be infeasible to guess and MUST be indistinguishable from uniformly random modulo r.

BBS proofs are nondeterministic, meaning care must be taken against attacks arising from using bad randomness, for example, the nonce reuse attack on ECDSA [@HDWH12]. It is RECOMMENDED that the presentation header used in this specification contain a nonce chosen at random from a trusted source of randomness, see the (#presentation-header-selection) for additional considerations.

BlindSign as discussed in 2.10 uses randomness from two parties so care MUST be taken that both sources of randomness are trusted. If one party uses weak randomness, it could compromise the signature.

When a trusted source of randomness is used, signatures and proofs are much harder to forge or break due to the use of multiple nonces.

## Presentation header selection

The signature proofs of knowledge generated in this specification are created using a specified presentation header. A verifier-specified cryptographically random value (e.g., a nonce) featuring in the presentation header provides strong protections against replay attacks, and is RECOMMENDED in most use cases. In some settings, proofs can be generated in a non-interactive fashion, in which case verifiers MUST be able to verify the uniqueness of the presentation header values.

## Implementing hash\_to\_curve\_g1

The security analysis models hash\_to\_curve\_g1 as random oracles.  It is crucial that these functions are implemented using a cryptographically secure hash function.  For this purpose, implementations MUST meet the requirements of [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve].

In addition, ciphersuites MUST specify unique domain separation tags for hash\_to\_curve.  Some guidance around defining this can be found in (#ciphersuites).

## Choice of underlying curve

BBS signatures can be implemented on any pairing-friendly curve. However care MUST be taken when selecting one that is appropriate, this specification defines a ciphersuite for using the BLS12-381 curve in (#ciphersuites) which as a curve achieves around 117 bits of security according to a recent NCC ZCash cryptography review [@ZCASH-REVIEW].

## Security of proofs generated by ProofGen

The proof, as returned by ProofGen, is a zero-knowledge proof-of-knowledge [@CDL16]. This guarantees that no information will be revealed about the signature itself or the undisclosed messages, from the output of ProofGen. Note that the security proofs in [@CDL16] work on type 3 pairing setting. This means that G1 should be different from G2 and with no efficient isomorphism between them.

# Ciphersuites

This section defines the format for a BBS ciphersuite. It also gives concrete ciphersuites based on the BLS12-381 pairing-friendly elliptic curve [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves].

## Ciphersuite Format

### Ciphersuite ID

The following section defines the format of the unique identifier for the ciphersuite denoted `Ciphersuite_ID`. The REQUIRED format for this string is

```
  "BBS_" || H2C_SUITE_ID || ADD_INFO
```

  *  Strings in double quotes are ASCII-encoded literals.

  *  H2C\_SUITE\_ID is the suite ID of the hash-to-curve suite used to define the hash_to_curve function.

  *  ADD\_INFO is an optional string indicating any additional information used to uniquely qualify the ciphersuite. When present this value MUST only contain ASCII characters between 0x21 and 0x7e (inclusive), and MUST end with an underscore (0x5f), other than the last character the string MUST not contain any other underscores (0x5f).

### Additional Parameters

- hash: a cryptographic hash function.

- point\_to\_octets_g1:
a function that returns the canonical representation of the point P for the G1 subgroup as an octet string.

- point\_to\_octets_g2:
a function that returns the canonical representation of the point P for the G2 subgroup as an octet string.

- octets\_to\_point_g1:
a function that returns the point P in the subgroup G1 corresponding to the canonical representation ostr, or INVALID if ostr is not a valid output of `point_to_octets_g1`.

- octets\_to\_point_g2:
a function that returns the point P in the subgroup G2 corresponding to the canonical representation ostr, or INVALID if ostr is not a valid output of `point_to_octets_g2`.

- hash\_to\_curve\_g1:
A cryptographic hash function that takes as an arbitrary octet string input and returns a point in G1 as defined in [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve].

- hash\_to\_curve\_g1\_dst: Domain separation tag used in the hash\_to\_curve\_g1 operation.

- hash\_to\_field: A cryptographic hash function that follows the procedure outlined in section 5.3 of [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve].

- hash\_to\_field\_dst: Domain separation tag used in the hash\_to\_field operation.

- hashing\_elements\_to\_scalars: either hash_to_scalar using hash (in this case hash MUST be an xof), or hash_to_field with the additional check and re-calculation of more elements until the desired number of non-zero field elements is returned (as described in [Hash to scalar](#hash-to-scalar)).

- message\_generator\_seed: The seed used to generate the message generators which form part of the public parameters used by the BBS signature scheme, Note there are multiple possible scopes for this seed including; a globally shared seed (where the resulting message generators are common across all BBS signatures); a signer specific seed (where the message generators are specific to a signer); signature specific seed (where the message generators are specific per signature). The ciphersuite MUST define this seed OR how to compute it as a pre-cursor operations to any others.

- blind\_value\_generator\_seed: The seed used to calculate the signature blinding value generator (H_s). Similar to the message\_generator\_seed, there are multiple scopes for the blind\_value\_generator\_seed, with the choices being a global seed, a signer specific seed or a signature specific seed. Also, the ciphersuite MUST define this seed OR how to compute it as a pre-cursor operations to any others.

- signature\_dst\_generator\_seed: The seed for calculating the generator used to sign the signature domain separation tag. The scopes and requirements for this seed are the same as the scopes and requirements of the message\_generator\_seed and blind\_value\_generator\_seed.

- xof\_no\_of\_bytes: Number of bytes to draw from the xof when performing operations such as creating generators as per the operation documented in (#creategenerators) or computing the e and s components of the signature generated in (#sign). It is RECOMMENDED this value be set to one greater than `ceil(r+k)/8` for the ciphersuite, where `r` and `k` are parameters from the underlying pairing friendly curve being used.

- octet\_scalar\_length: Number of bytes to represent a scalar value, in the multiplicative group of integers mod r, encoded as an octet string. It is RECOMMENDED this value be set to `ceil(log2(r)/8)`.

- octet\_point\_length: Number of bytes to represent a point encoded as an octet string outputted by the `point_to_octets_g*` function. It is RECOMMENDED that this value is set to `ceil(log2(p)/8)`.

## Usecases

### Non-correlating Security Token

In the most general sense BBS signatures can be used in any application where a cryptographically secured token is required but correlation caused by usage of the token is un-desirable.

For example in protocols like OAuth2.0 the most commonly used form of the access token leverages the JWT format alongside conventional cryptographic primitives such as traditional digital signatures or HMACs. These access tokens are then used by a relying party to prove authority to a resource server during a request. However, because the access token is most commonly sent by value as it was issued by the authorization server (e.g in a bearer style scheme), the access token can act as a source of strong correlation for the relying party. Relevant prior art can be found [here](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-private-access-tokens-01.html).

BBS Signatures due to their unique properties removes this source of correlation but maintains the same set of guarantees required by a resource server to validate an access token back to its relevant authority (note that an approach to signing JSON tokens with BBS that may be of relevance is the [JWP](https://json-web-proofs.github.io/json-web-proofs/draft-jmiller-json-web-proof.html) format and serialization). In the context of a protocol like OAuth2.0 the access token issued by the authorization server would feature a BBS Signature, however instead of the relying party providing this access token as issued, in their request to a resource server, they derive a unique proof from the original access token and include that in the request instead, thus removing this vector of correlation.

### Improved Bearer Security Token

Bearer based security tokens such as JWT based access tokens used in the OAuth2.0 protocol are a highly popular format for expressing authorization grants. However their usage has several security limitations. Notably a bearer based authorization scheme often has to rely on a secure transport between the authorized party (client) and the resource server to mitigate the potential for a MITM attack or a malicious interception of the access token. The scheme also has to assume a degree of trust in the resource server it is presenting an access token to, particularly when the access token grants more than just access to the target resource server, because in a bearer based authorization scheme, anyone who possesses the access token has authority to what it grants. Bearer based access tokens also suffer from the threat of replay attacks.

Improved schemes around authorization protocols often involve adding a layer of proof of cryptographic key possession to the presentation of an access token, which mitigates the deficiencies highlighted above as well as providing a way to detect a replay attack. However, approaches that involve proof of cryptographic key possession such as DPoP (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop-04) suffer from an increase in protocol complexity. A party requesting authorization must pre-generate appropriate key material, share the public portion of this with the authorization server alongside proving possession of the private portion of the key material. The authorization server must also be-able to accommodate receiving this information and validating it.

BBS Signatures ofter an alternative model that solves the same problems that proof of cryptographic key possession schemes do for bearer based schemes, but in a way that doesn't introduce new up-front protocol complexity. In the context of a protocol like OAuth2.0 the access token issued by the authorization server would feature a BBS Signature, however instead of the relying party providing this access token as issued, in their request to a resource server, they derive a unique proof from the original access token and include that in the request instead. Because the access token is not shared in a request to a resource server, attacks such as MITM are mitigated. A resource server also obtains the ability to detect a replay attack by ensuring the proof presented is unique.

### Modified Message Signature

Using the following message

```
{{ $signatureFixtures.signature002.messages[0] }}
```

And the following signature

```
{{ $signatureFixtures.signature002.signature }}
```

Along with the PK value as defined in (#key-pair) as inputs into the Verify operation should fail signature validation due to the message value being different from what was signed

### Extra Unsigned Message Signature

Using the following messages

```
{{ $signatureFixtures.signature003.messages[0] }}

{{ $signatureFixtures.signature003.messages[1] }}
```

And the following signature

```
{{ $signatureFixtures.signature002.signature }}
```

Along with the PK value as defined in (#key-pair) as inputs into the Verify operation should fail signature validation due to an additional message being supplied that was not signed

### Missing Message Signature

Using the following messages

```
{{ $signatureFixtures.signature005.messages[0] }}

{{ $signatureFixtures.signature005.messages[1] }}
```

And the following signature

```
{{ $signatureFixtures.signature005.signature }}
```

Along with the PK value as defined in (#key-pair) as inputs into the Verify operation should fail signature validation due to missing messages that were originally present during the signing

### Reordered Message Signature

Using the following messages

```
{{ $signatureFixtures.signature006.messages[0] }}

```

And the following signature

```
{{ $signatureFixtures.signature006.signature }}
```

Along with the PK value as defined in (#key-pair) as inputs into the Verify operation should fail signature validation due to messages being re-ordered from the order in which they were signed

```

Along with the PK value as defined in (#key-pair) as inputs into the Verify operation should fail signature validation due to public key used to verify is in-correct

## Proof Generation and Verification Algorithmic Explanation

The following section provides an explanation of how the ProofGen and ProofVerify operations work.

Let the prover be in possession of a BBS signature `(A, e, s)` with `A = B * (1/(e + Sk))` where `Sk` the signer's secret key and,

    B = P1 + h0 * s + h[1] * msg_1 + ... + h[L] * msg_L

(without loss of generality we assume that the messages and generators are indexed from 0 to L). Let `(i1,...,iR)` be the indexes of generators corresponding to messages the prover wants to disclose and `(j1,...,jU)` be the indexes corresponding to undisclosed messages (i.e., `(j1,...,jU) = [L] \ (i1,...,iR)`). To prove knowledge of a signature on the disclosed messages, work as follows,

- Randomize the signature `(A, e, s)`, by taking uniformly random `r1`, `r2` in [1, r-1], and calculate,

        1.  A' = A * r1,
        2.  Abar = A' * (-e) + B * r1
        3.  D = B * r1 + H0 * r2.

  Also set,

        4.  r3 = r1 ^ -1 mod r
        5.  s' = s + r2 * r3.

  The values `(A', Abar, d)` will be part of the proof and are used to prove possession of a BBS signature, without revealing the signature itself. Note that; `e(A', Pk) = e(Abar, P2)` where `Pk` the signer's public key and P2 the base element in G2 (used to create the signer’s `Pk`, see [SkToPk](#sktopk)). This also serves to bind the proof to the signer's `Pk`.

- Set the following,

        1.  C1 = Abar - D
        2.  C2 = P1 +  H_i1 * msg_i1 + ... + H_iR * msg_iR

  Create a non-interactive zero-knowledge generalized Schnorr proof of knowledge (`nizk`) of the values `e, r2, r3, s'` and `msg_j1,...,msg_jU` (the undisclosed messages) so that both of the following equalities hold,

        EQ1.  C1 = A' * (-e) - H0 * r2
        EQ2.  C2 = D * (-r3) + H0 * s' + H_j1 * msg_j1 + ... + H_jU * msg_jU.

  If both EQ1 and EQ2 hold, and `e(A', Pk) = e(Abar, P2)`, an extractor can return a valid BBS signature from the signers `Sk`, on the disclosed messages. The proof returned is `(A', Abar, d, nizk)`. To validate the proof, a verifier checks that `e(A', Pk) = e(Abar, P2)` and verifies `nizk`.
